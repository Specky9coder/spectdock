A skilled Flutter developer with proven expertise in using new tools and technical developments to drive improvements throughout an entire software development lifecycle.

In my swiss army knife of FullStack skills, Flutter is my sharpest blade.

Excellent communication skills and ability to work alongside support teams and the flutter community to define and refine new functionality.

Looking for an ambitious company that will challenge my developing and problem solving skills and allows me to continue to develop my knowledge and potential.

With over 4 years of experience in Software development, I've contributed to communities and startups alike, and so far, thankfully nothing has fallen apart.

From here on out, it's just Onwards and Upwards ðŸš€

On a more personal note, I spend my time working on my numerous [side projects](https://reubence.com/projects), contribute a little to open-source, and reach out to entrepreneurs on communities like [Indie Hackers](https://www.indiehackers.com/reubence).
